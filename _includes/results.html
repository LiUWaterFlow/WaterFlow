            <h2>Our Results</h2>
            <p>The project resulted in a 2D solution for water visualization in large scale terrains, which simulates and renders in realtime on decent hardware. A visually pleasing water rendering was implemented and the results can be seen below.</p>

             <p>A full 3D solver was implemented and rejected due to the slowness of the method. The Shallow Water Equations were investigated as a more suitable method for physically based simulation and two different methods were implemented and evaluated on the CPU. The heightfield method presented in the final product is however, unsuitable as a physically based simulation tool as it does not guarantee volume preservation and is very hard to link to physical values in terms of flow etc.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AcCJroW55KY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
